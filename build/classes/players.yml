# Player list file.
# All players who have used any part of this plugin will be listed here.
# The following format MUST be followed.
#
# players:
#   PlayerName:
#     jobs:
#       - JOBNAME
#     invites: []
#
# PlayerNames are case sensitive, and it's therefore best to let the plugin add
# people on it's own. JobNames need to be UpperCase, and the rest of the headings
# must be lowercase. Both 'jobs' and 'invites' must be listed, if one is empty,
# simply add ' []' after the colon.
