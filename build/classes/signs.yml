# Sign config zone
# Example of a sign:
#
# signs:
#   sign0:
#     x: -131.0
#     y: 72.0
#     z: 224.0
#     world: world
#     type: GET
#     job: FARMER
#
# Sign names are completely irrelevant and will likely be changed with every
# save. The items under the sign title are all required. 'x', 'y', and 'z' are
# coordinates for the world listed in 'world'. Together the plugin makes a
# Location class out of those 4 and lists a sign with type 'type' and job 'job'
# at that Location. 'world' is CASE SENSITIVE. 'type' is always either GET or
# QUIT, and must be uppercase. 'job' must be uppercase, and must list a real job.
