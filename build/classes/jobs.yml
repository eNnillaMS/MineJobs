# Job configuration file:
# This is where all the SERVER jobs are defined.
# Server jobs pay money from the server, custom jobs pay from the job creator.
# Jobs must follow the following format:
#
# jobs:
#   JOBNAME:
#     maxplayers: 0
#     break:
#       STONE: 0.25
#       GOLD_ORE: 5
#       CROPS#7: 0.66
#     place: {}
#     mobs: {}
#     fish: {}
#     tools: {}
#     craft: {}
#     smelt: {}
#     brew: {}
#     enchant:
#       active: false
#       payPerLevel: 0
#     worlds:
#     - world1
#     - world2
#     pkl: false
#
# JOBNAMES must be all UpperCase. Every value here has an internally set default
# in case you want to leave it out. 'maxplayers' defines how many players can have
# this job at once, where 0 is the default and equals unlimited. 'worlds' is a CASE
# SENSITIVE list of the worlds the job will have any effect on, it's default if
# you choose to leave it out is a list of all the worlds on the server. 'pkl' is
# a boolean defining whether or not dieing with this job will result in losing
# the amount of money set in config.yml under 'DeathLosses.Loss' PER JOB WITH PKL.
# The 'break', 'place', 'mobs', 'fish', 'tools', 'craft', 'smelt', and 'brew' fields
# are all very similar in their formatting. None are required, and they will all
# default as being empty. 'break' is the payout for breaking blocks. Items listed
# under it are listed using their entry from the Bukkit Material (or Entity) Class,
# which sometimes results in underscores in the names. Likewise, if you need to
# use a Data Value on a block (say, WOOL, for coloring), you can add a "#" and
# then the value you want. Lastly, the enchant fields are used to define whether
# or not players get paid for enchanting. 'active' is a simple boolean, and
# 'payPerLevel' is a double. Not necessary to have in if you don't want it, and will
# default to off.
