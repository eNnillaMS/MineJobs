# Custom job configuration file:
# All jobs created by players will appear here.
# ----------
# See jobs.yml for info on how to manually create a job.
# Only difference between what's there and what's here is that jobs here need
# two extra fields. Among other fields, the job would look like:
#
# customs:
#   JOBNAME:
#     owner: PlayerNameHere
#     locked: false
#         ...
#
# Owner is the name of the player whom will be charged for all work done on the job.
# Locked decides whether or not players can join on their own or need an invitation first.
